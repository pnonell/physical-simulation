# Part 2: Satellite orbiting the Earth

To run the simulation, open the file main.pde and run it on Processing.

There are 4 different options (A, B, C and D), which can be switched by changing the letter on line 15 of the code.

- Option A:
    
    The satellite receives only the force of gravity from the Earth and it falls accelerating towards the Earth until it collides.
    
- Option B:

    The satellite orbits around the Earth forming an ellipse. It also calculates the eccentricity of the orbit using the minimum and maximum radius.
    
- Option C:
    
    The satellite orbits around the Earth forming an ellipse. The user can press the Return key of the keyboard to calculate the area traced by the satellite in an instant of time. With this we can validate the second law of Kepler which says that "A line joining a planet and a satellite sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time". To calculate the areas, the methods of Trapezio and Simpson are used.
 
- Option D:

    The satellite orbits around the Earth forming a circle. To achive that the satellite must be in a distance of the Earth where the centripetal and gravitational force are equal.
