# Part 1 - The Snake game

To run the game, open the file main.pde and run it on Processing.

The head of the snake will follow the mouse and the body parts will follow the head. You will have 60 seconds to eat as many worms as you can.

Both the head and the body parts move simulating a spring behaviour: the further away they are, the faster they move.
